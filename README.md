# AjaxExample
## Instructions:
Running the example is as simple as starting the python server, and going to localhost:81

Going to this address will bring you to the client's interface. If you want to go to the master's interface, go to localhost:81/master

The example in its latest commit is capable of starting a FAKE server, stopping it, getting whatever its running or not, and on the client side, adding clients and removing them when their last keepalive timed out.
